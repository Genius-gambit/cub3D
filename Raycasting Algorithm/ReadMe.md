# Raycasting Algorithm

My Approach for the algorithm some references I gathered from the guideline of cub3D and some references from the videos of raycasting. 

Angles defined in the algorithm are mostly in degrees, some are mentioned in radians.

Thanks to Hussain for collaborating with me on this fun project. Hope to work with you again in future projects.
